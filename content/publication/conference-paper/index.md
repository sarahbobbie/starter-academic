abstract: The cerebellum plays a known role in human speech motor control, but its role in speech perception and language comprehension remains somewhat of a mystery. Recent neuroimaging meta-analyses report a functional topology of activation in the cerebellum related to language use. However, these meta-analyses are based on a small number of studies and they fail to illuminate the roles of the cerebellum in both language use and the subprocesses that define it. Here we conduct a large scale and specific meta-analysis to test the prediction that the cerebellum contains distinct circuits for action and perception in speech processing.
