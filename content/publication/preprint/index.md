abstract: Studies of language representations in bilingual individuals thus far have produced conflicting reports; many patient/case studies suggest languages are represented independently, while imaging and behavioural studies show mixed results with age of acquisition and proficiency level differentially impacting representations. The present study employed an experimental model of sensorimotor learning in speech using altered auditory feedback to investigate the relationship between speech production and language representations in a group of 20 adult English/French bilinguals. To induce sensorimotor learning, participants produced full sentences in either English or French while altered auditory feedback was applied to their vowel sounds in real time. All participants produced English sentences in one session and French sentences in the other. Before and after learning, a transfer test involving the production of isolated words in both English and French assessed vowel production in the absence of auditory feedback (i.e., speech was heavily noise masked). The amount of speech motor learning within each language was measured as well as the degree of transfer of the adaptation from one language to another. Results indicated equal amounts of learning in English and French and equivalent transfer between and within both languages. The present study suggests that, in bilinguals, speech motor learning acquired in the context of one language is broadly applicable to a second language. The work supports the idea that the motor programs used to communicate language are shared in the bilingual brain.
