abstract: For normal-hearing individuals, comprehending speech is usually a relatively effortless experience. We don’t have to consciously expend a lot of resources and effort to try to understand what’s being said in most situations. However, for individuals with hearing loss, comprehending speech can often be a very effortful experience that can lead to fatigue and stress. For children with hearing loss, comprehending speech is something they have to do every day in the classroom. COVID-19 has recently presented additional challenges through the transition to online learning. We know that children with hearing loss experience greater fatigue and effort when listening to speech in the classroom than children with normal hearing. But what we don’t yet know is how this manifests in the virtual classroom, where teachers may now have to rely more heavily on speech to try to engage their students. It is therefore very important to understand the nature of listening effort and engagement in this population to ensure that all children can benefit from education equally.
