First, you'll need to have R import the data. I like to use the function read_csv, which imports your data as a tibble; if you import the data this way, you'll need to install tidyverse and call readr from the library. Here's how I imported my data:
```{r}
tutorial_csv <- read_csv("./ggplot_tutorial_dataset.csv")
```
Now let's take a look at what kind of data we have.
I recommend taking a look at {{< staticref "media/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf" "newtab" >}}this ggplot cheatsheet{{< /staticref >}}. It's an excellent reference for all aspects of ggplot, and can even be used to help you figure out which type of plot is most suitable for your data.
library(readr)
ggplot_tutorial_dataset <- read_csv("content/post/internal-project/ggplot_tutorial_dataset.csv")
View(ggplot_tutorial_dataset)
```
ggplot(tutorial_csv, aes(x = Happiness, y = Optimism)) +
geom_jitter(colour = "violetred4", width = 0.5, height = 0.5)
```
You can also play around with the aesthetics of the plot. Select colours based on their names in R using {{< staticref "media/Rcolor.pdf" "newtab" >}}this handy chart,{{< /staticref >}} or enter the HEX values for any colour you like. You can even find some downloadable user-made colour palettes that will give your plots a nice cohesive look - [this Wes Anderson-inspired package](https://github.com/karthik/wesanderson) is a personal favourite.

Now let's take a look at what kind of data we have. You'll see that we have columns for participant ID, age, and sex, followed by their relationship status ("Yes" indicates that the participant is in a long-term relationship, whereas "No" indicates that they are not) and some scores on measures of happiness and optimism. In this case, let's assume that a "5" indicates higher levels of happiness/optimism, and a "1" indicates lower levels.

ggplot_tutorial_dataset <- read_csv("ggplot_tutorial_dataset.csv")

I like to use the function read_csv, which imports your data as a tibble; if you import the data this way, you'll need to install tidyverse and call readr from the library. Alternativele, you can just call the entire tiduverse, which will also call ggplot2. Here's how I imported my data:

install.packages("tidyverse")

tutorial_csv <- read_csv("./ggplot_tutorial_dataset.csv")
